## What is Docker? 

"Installing Docker" really means "Installing the Docker Engine and CLI".

- The **Docker Engine** is a daemon (a service running in the background).
  
- This daemon manages containers in a similar way that a hypervisor manages virtual machines (VMs).

- We interact with the Docker Engine by using the **Docker CLI**.

- The Docker CLI and Docker Engine communicate through an API.

- There are many other programs and client libraries which use that API.
