1. Image = files + metadata

2. These files form the root filesystem of our container.

3. The metadata can indicate a number of things, e.g.:

4. the author of the image

5. the command to execute in the container when starting it environment variables to be set etc.

6. Images are made of layers, conceptually stacked on top of each other.

7. Each layer can add, change, and remove files and/or metadata.

8. Images can share layers to optimize disk usage, transfer times, and memory use.
